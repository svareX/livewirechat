# LivewireChat

## About the project 
LivewireChat is a web application inspired by [Facebook's Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/). This project was my the first hands-on work with "real" front-end technologies, thanks to Livewire. Altough it is a smaller project, it still has some of the more basic functions like user registering, authenticating, authorizing using email verification. The application supports both dark and light mode depending on user's browser settings.


## Technologies used to accomplish this solution are:

 - [Laravel](https://laravel.com/)
 - [Livewire v2](https://laravel-livewire.com/)
 - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
 
## Try it yourself!
First you need to clone the repository.

    git clone https://github.com/svareX/livewirechat

Then install all the package and dependencies.

    composer install

After that you need to setup an .env file (use the .env.example as a template)

    copy .env.example .env

Generate a new application key

    php artisan key:generate
 
 Install front-end packages

    npm install

 Compile front-end assets in real-time

    npm run dev
       
**Now, you must leave this terminal window running and open a new one!**
Create your database table.

    php artisan migrate


While you have a local database server like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/)
Then all you need to do is to start a local Laravel server.

    php artisan serve
